        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
        <p class="text">Filling fun and thrill in routine can be understood as an adventure. The future is unpredictable. For some people, the meaning of adventure revolves around it. Activities that performed without thinking of the outcomes can be defined as an adventure. There is not a definite definition of adventure.
            <br><br>
           An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, paragliding, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, surfing or other extreme sports.

           <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials.
            <br><br>
            Mountain biking involves riding a mountain bike in terrain, usually on trails, forests, dirt, or gravel roads. Mountain bikes are known for their suspension fork (eventually also rear suspension), flat or high-rise handlebar, and wide and knobby tires.

            <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
         </div>
         <P class="text">
            Paragliding has a relatively short history, involving many people across the United States and France. Early versions of paragliding were derived from the preexisting parachute, which was round in shape, and designed to descent safely. The earliest known paragliding was performed by the US military in their parachute landing training.
            <br><br>
            Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits.

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
         </div>
         <P class="text">
            Surfing is a surface water pastime in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.... However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.
            <br><br>
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing ), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water.
